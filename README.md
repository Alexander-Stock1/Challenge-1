## Challenge 1
This is my first assignment and is a revisted version of starter code that i rewrote to main more streamline.
## What I did
I removed a lot of the different classes that did the same thing and instead made files that had everything in them
thus cutting down on the amount of spaghetti you have to stare at to understand the code.
